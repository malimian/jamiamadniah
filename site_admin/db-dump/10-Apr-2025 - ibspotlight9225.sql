analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers found Friday surgeries were more likely to be performed by junior surgeons when compared to Monday surgeries. &ldquo;This difference in expertise may play a role in the observed differences in outcomes,&rdquo; they wrote, based on a statistical analysis that controlled for other factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There could also be fewer senior colleagues on the hospital campus for the junior physicians to consult with, the authors said. In addition, the weekend doctors and nurses may be less familiar with the patient&rsquo;s case, raising the risk that complications will be caught later and therefore lead to worse outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is common for hospitals to have fewer doctors and nurses working the weekends and those who do work tend to be less experienced, which could likewise help explain the study&rsquo;s findings, said Betty Rambur, a nursing professor at the University of Rhode Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The combination of fewer staff and less experienced staff certainly can contribute to poor patient outcomes,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The findings should motivate hospital executives to rethink how they are staffing their wards on Fridays and over the weekend, to avoid complications that put surgery patients in danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, this is also useful information for any of us who need elective surgery at any point in the future.

This finding has prompted healthcare professionals to rethink their timing of surgical procedures, as the day of the week could play a significant role in post operative survival rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"1139\" data-start=\"611\">A major finding from this study is that patients who undergo surgery on Fridays are at a significantly higher risk of death. The research, which analyzed data from hospitals in Ontario, Canada, showed that individuals who had surgeries just before the weekend faced a higher risk of death at 30 days (9% increase), 90 days (10%), and one year (12%) compared to surgeries performed after the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-end=\"2114\" data-start=\"2073\"><strong data-end=\"2114\" data-start=\"2077\">Why Are Friday Surgeries Riskier?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2462\" data-start=\"2116\">several factors contribute to the increased risk with Friday surgeries. One of the most effective risks are &ldquo;staff fatigue&rdquo;. Surgeons and medical professionals are tired after a long week of back to back surgeries, which can affect their concentration and performance on fridays. This could lead to increased chances of complications during and after surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"2760\" data-start=\"2464\">Another factor is &ldquo;hospital resources&rdquo;. Many hospitals operate on a decreased capacity during the weekends, with fewer staff and fewer specialists available. If patients require emergency care or a consult from a senior doctor, it may not be as readily accessible on Friday evenings and weekends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3070\" data-start=\"2762\">Last, the &ldquo;weekend effect&rdquo; plays a huge role. The weekend effect refers to the event where hospitals, particularly those with fewer resources or less staffing, may struggle to provide timely post-surgical monitoring. This gap in care can add to the risks associated with surgery and recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3455\" data-start=\"3180\">Several factors, including staff fatigue, reduced hospital staffing, and fewer available resources, contribute to the increased risks of Friday surgeries. Medical staff might be tired after a busy week, and the weekend staffing shortage can delay post-operative care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3832\" data-start=\"3524\">While it&rsquo;s not always possible to choose the timing of a surgery, patients concerned about the risks associated with Friday surgeries should discuss their options with their healthcare providers. Surgeons can offer advice on the optimal timing of procedures based on the patient&rsquo;s condition and surgery type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"3832\" data-start=\"3524\"><a aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-haspopup=\"dialog\" aria-label=\"View full size photo\" href=\"https://esteemstream.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zqemeab-wpy.jpg\"><img alt=\"a person in a hospital bed with an iv\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"274\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" src=\"https://esteemstream.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zqemeab-wpy-600x400.jpg\" srcset=\"https://esteemstream.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zqemeab-wpy-600x400.jpg 600w, https://esteemstream.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zqemeab-wpy-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://esteemstream.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zqemeab-wpy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://esteemstream.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zqemeab-wpy-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://esteemstream.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zqemeab-wpy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://esteemstream.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/zqemeab-wpy.jpg 1600w\" width=\"411\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-end=\"4291\" data-start=\"4246\"><strong data-end=\"4291\" data-start=\"4250\">Conclusion</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p data-end=\"4796\" data-start=\"4293\">The timing of surgical procedures plays a significant role in patient outcomes. The study&rsquo;s findings indicate that Friday surgeries are associated with a 12% higher mortality rate than those performed earlier in the week. Factors like staff fatigue, limited resources, and the weekend effect contribute to this increased risk. As healthcare providers continue to explore these correlations, there is a push to consider how surgical schedules can be improved for better patient outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Related stories:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/health/friday-surgeries-higher-death-risk\">https://interestingengineering.com/health/friday-surgeries-higher-death-risk</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-weekends-affect-surgical-outcomes.html\">https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-weekends-affect-surgical-outcomes.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/youre-more-likely-to-die-if-you-have-surgery-on-a-friday/\">https://www.vice.com/en/article/youre-more-likely-to-die-if-you-have-surgery-on-a-friday/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-surgery-weekend-bad-idea.html\">https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-03-surgery-weekend-bad-idea.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/dont-have-surgery-on-a-friday-youre-more-likely-to-die-study-shows-78334\">https://www.iflscience.com/dont-have-surgery-on-a-friday-youre-more-likely-to-die-study-shows-78334</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Take Action:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/having-surgery-at-the-end-of-the-week-could-make-a-concerning-difference\">https://www.sciencealert.com/having-surgery-at-the-end-of-the-week-could-make-a-concerning-difference</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://advisory.com/daily-briefing/2025/03/10/weekend-effect\">https://advisory.com/daily-briefing/2025/03/10/weekend-effect</a></p>\r\n','Study Reveals Friday Surgeries Linked To 12% Higher Death Risk Than Early Week Operations','','','93','1','0',NULL,'1','zqemeab-wpy_67e1eae436eb9.jpg','0','1',NULL,NULL,'1','0','1','2025-03-25 04:29:54','2025-03-25 04:39:36','0'),

Among the long lines that have been coming with it. Because it is a disgrace that you are not able to feed the poor in a land of plenty when you fix roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All of us who are here now, we came from Ondo, and our ears are banging as we are here now as if we went to an amusement park. So I think that we should have a serious government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our constitution is designed with serious language in it. They are expecting that the person who is the president, Head of State, or Commander in chief will be someone who knows that this is the airport of black people in the world. And we should not be a basket case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Poverty, insecurity, underdevelopment, unemployment, those are the things that we are having conversations about. There are those who want to get to power anyhow and they will combine even with the devil&#8221;,he stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are clamouring to serve the people. They are clamouring for themselves, Nigerians have reached a point that there is no where to go. In the next five years, population will grow by at least 10%. There&#8217;s no work, there&#8217;s no food, there&#8217;s no education, there&#8217;s no housing, there&#8217;s no space in the public service. &#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing,he said,&#8221;President Muhammad Bihari came on National Television and said, “in my government, there is no space for anybody. Go and farm.” But he didn&#8217;t give lands, he didn&#8217;t give security, he didn&#8217;t give fertilizer. So, these people are not even talking to you, Tinubu is more of a president of France, maybe deputy president of France, than a president of Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So we need to be serious, it is not about giving position, it&#8217;s about serving the people. The true position that is relevant in Nigeria is the position of citizen of the Federal republic of Nigeria. Let them say, “why are you smiling?” You&#8217;ll say because I&#8217;m a Nigerian. Why are you well fed? Because I&#8217;m a Nigerian. Why did you get this job? Because I&#8217;m a Nigerian. Why do you feel safe to speak? Because I&#8217;m a Nigerian. When last did you count all the asset God gave to you and you remembered you are a Nigerian? That must happen in our lifetime.&#8221;he said</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Answering another question on the state of emergency in Rivers State, the SDP presidential flagbearer said it was pathetic and unfortunate that the president could delete democratic structure in the state without recourse to the overall condition of the masses in the state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to him: &#8220;the president removed elected officials, both in the legislative and executive arm. That is clearly unconstitutional and the political leaders in the country, particularly Rivers State should remember that power that defines the constitution comes from the people and for the benefit of the people, they should resolve that issue immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, the state of emergency is that the SDP has spoken about it. We feel like the president has declared an emergency but the reason has not been given to us. We have also removed elected officials, both in the legislative and executive arm. That is clearly unconstitutional and the political leaders in the country, particularly Rivers state should remember that power that defines the constitution comes from the people and for the benefit of the people and that they should resolve the issue.The fact that an emergency had been declared for six months doesn&#8217;t mean that it can&#8217;t be resolved in six hours or six days.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adewole particularly urged the power that be in the country to have a rethink about the ongoing emergency rule in River state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking on the role played by the National Assembly on the Rivers State crisis, the SDP candidate said,&#8221; It is an unserious matter. The National Assembly is not set up for us to cooperate. The crisis in the National Assembly is how they approved a 55 trillion Naira budget without anything for the people. How they approved almost 40 trillion last year and nobody has seen anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And the National Assembly, when the President came to present this new fake budget, the Speaker said last year&#8217;s budget performed below 25%. So if you have a student who performed below 25%, will you promote that student to the next class? So we should, especially the media, it is an opportunity to talk to you.<br>&#8221; It is not every sensation that is reported, focus more on what is happening, why Nigerian people are left behind. Even in River State, I will speak about it. If you ask the media how much was River State&#8217;s budget last year, how much went to the poor? How many children have been educated in River State, they will not tell you. They tell you Wike, Fubara, Wike, Fubara. So the media needs to be a little more serious.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He further noted that,&#8221;the National Assembly was not set up for romantic stories. It was set up for people to do the work of Nigerian people and do more to return to that. The seriousness that is happening in Nigeria today, if you look at the thousands of hungry people, people who are kidnapped and their families are looking for ransom, children are out of school. There are so many problems in this country.The National Assembly should have no drama for boy and girl stories.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Answering a question on the people who are drifting to the party clamoring to occupy elective positions, Adewole said that,&#8221; the aim of SDP is to take over the governance from the elite adding that party is one of the oldest party in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What we know is that in this country, we are older than all these parties they are talking about. And this is a party of MKO Abiola. This is a party of Falaye. This is a party that has produced many people like Abubakar Rimi. This is a party for Solomon Lar. So all these people you are mentioning, where did they come from? The conspiracy that led to the creation of APC, where did this start? So these people who are the leaders of APC now, they were Farenda Boys in SDP. How can they be telling you what to do?he queried</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that,&#8221;for every known politician, for every former minister, for every ex-governor, and senators, jumping to our party, there are millions of Nigerians joining the party. So it is now for the media to look for Nigerian people.<br>&#8220;So it is part of the system to bring egalitarianism. That&#8217;s why Chapter 2 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of the press, and makes the press the fourth estate of the realm. So in fact, when we talk of the neglect of Nigerian people by the government, the neglect of the suffering of Nigerians by the media, or the legal system where I belong.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explaining why he hosted Iftar in Ilorin, Kwara state, Adewole said<br>&#8220;Ilorin is a well known center for Islam in Southern Sudan.The southern Sudan worth in the whole Islamic Calendar is called the lower Sudan, so everybody all over the world knows that Ilorin is the center for Islam. It is the city of Islamic knowledge, and I remember that even when I worked in the North Africa and Middle East, some of the most complex interpretations of Arabic and of Islamic traditions, they used to refer to the people of Ilorin here. But in addition to that, we are doing this in many parts of the country.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/03/sdp-knocks-tinubus-administration-on-poverty-redemption-insecurity-food-security/\">SDP knocks Tinubu&#8217;s administration on poverty redemption, insecurity, food security</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>\n','SDP knocks Tinubu’s administration on poverty redemption, insecurity, food security','Demola Akinyemi, Ilorin,News,ibspotlight','…. says it&amp;#8217;s a failure and colossal disappointment.

While some concurred with the statement that democracy was collapsing, others disagreed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the 60th birthday colloquim of former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Chief Emeka Ihedioha, on Monday, Mr Obi, former President Olusegun Obasanjo; former Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal and Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Kukah, said democracy was not working in Nigeria under President Bola Tinubu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, Obi likened Nigeria&#8217;s democracy since 1999 to a building that has been demolished. He said: “If you look at where we are today, it is like they started in 1999, laid the foundation; some people came and took it to the decking; and some people were trying to raise it to the first floor; and some people came and knocked everything down. That is the situation we are in right now. Everything has been knocked down. Nothing works.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-watch-your-words-onanuga-warns-obi\">Watch your words, Onanuga warns Obi</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reacting to Obi&#8217;s comment, a presidential aide, Mr Bayo Onanuga, cautioned the former Anambra State Governor to be mindful of his statements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Onanuga, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), yesterday, dismissed Obi’s claims as exaggerated and lacking in logical foundation, insisting that democracy in Nigeria has only grown stronger over the past 26 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I listened multiple times to former Governor Peter Obi’s statement in this clip, where he claims that democracy has collapsed in Nigeria. His hyperbolic remarks, suited for headlines, have been made without deep reflection and lack a solid logical foundation,” Onanuga wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Special Adviser to President Bola Tinubu on Information and Strategy further argued that if democracy had indeed collapsed, Obi would not have been able to express his views so freely at the colloquium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Only a discontented and disgruntled Peter, who benefits from the very free speech democracy provides, could perceive such a democratic downfall through his lens. If democracy had indeed collapsed, as Peter claims, and we were living under a regime antithetical to democratic principles, he would not have been able to make his comments on Monday,” he stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Onanuga warned Obi against making statements that could mislead the public, urging him to exercise restraint and avoid what he described as playing to the gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I will urge him to watch what he says and restrain himself from playing to the gallery,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tinubu-s-descent-into-full-blown-dictatorship-s-worrisome-obidients\">Tinubu’s descent into full blown dictatorship&#8217;s worrisome — Obidients</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Countering Onanuga, the Obidient Movement, an umbrella body of supporters of Obi, raised concerns over what it called President Tinubu administration’s descent into full blown dictatorship.“Director, Strategic Communications and Media of the movement, Nana Kazaure, in a statement in Abuja, said the tendency for the Tinubu Administration to bury its head in the sand and play the ostrich has become one of its defining characteristics.“Kazaure said: “As a Movement, we take serious exception to the uncouth threat by this choleric presidential spokesman whose antecedents as an instigator of intolerance and division is well known, recorded and documented.““Having taken note of Mr. Onanuga&#8217;s threat, we ask him the question: &#8220;watch his mouth.. or what? What exactly are Onanuga&#8217;s plan for Peter Obi?““Or put more directly, what sinister plans has the Tinubu administration for its critics whose ranks swell daily on account of the administration&#8217;s cluelessness, and inability to provide sound and qualitative governance for Nigerians?““We submit that if the Tinubu administration had invested a quarter of the energy and resources it expends in hounding and demonizing varying opinions through its intemperate spokespersons and numerous cyber Rottweilers, Nigeria would be a far more decent and conducive place to live in.““The threat issued to Peter Obi whilst completely in character, should not at all be discountenanced for as the 2023 elections showed, inciting words from highly placed APC officials including Mr. Onanuga himself helped to unleash violence, murder and destruction, as well as ethnic hatred from which Nigeria has yet to recover.““We are therefore putting Nigerians and the international community on strong notice that should any harm of any sort befall Peter Obi, his family or any of his associates, these culprits who have clearly identified themselves by their vitriolic speech, will be held entirely responsible.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-democracy-no-longer-working-in-nigeria-wabara\">Democracy no longer working in Nigeria — Wabara</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Former Senate President Adolphus Wabara, supported the assertion that democracy is no longer working in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the Methodist Archbishop of Umuahia Diocese, Archbishop Raphael Opoko, said that Nigeria no longer practises democracy but what he described as &#8216;selectocracy&#8217; (government of the select by the select).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senator Wabara who spoke with Vanguard regretted that in practice, Nigeria had veered off from the true meaning of democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to him, democracy has been distorted and corrupted in Nigeria to the extent that what is currently practiced in the country is fake version of democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said:&#8221;I didn&#8217;t have anything to add or subtract from what they (Obasanjo, Obi and Kukah) have said. Democracy is definitely failing in Nigeria. Maybe we don&#8217;t even understand what democracy is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a borrowed system and we don&#8217;t understand what it actually is. So, I agree with them. These are visionary and spiritual leaders. They are absolutely right.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the way forward, the former Senate President called for constitutional amendment and the reduction of excess powers vested with the President.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The way forward is for us to imbibe the tenets of democracy. We need a truly Nigerian democracy that accommodates our culture. To say we&#8217;re practicing democracy in Nigeria is hypocrisy. The practice of democracy in Nigeria goes worse everyday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For us to get it right, we must tinker with our Constitution and whittle down the powers of the President. We need to accommodate our culture and tradition . Our tradition is not corruption but honesty and truthfulness&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nigeria-practising-selectocracy-not-democracy-archbishop-opoko\">Nigeria practising &#8216;selectocracy&#8217; not democracy — Archbishop Opoko</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bishop Opoko said that democracy has become &#8220;an endangered species in Nigeria.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the cleric, democracy in Nigeria is under threat and grossly abused by those in authority.<br>He further lamented that the judiciary is not independent, adding that it is fast losing public confidence.<br>&#8220;There&#8217;s no justice anymore. Before now the judiciary used to be the hope of the common man but not any longer. Where is the hope of the common man again?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Archbishop Opoko also said that weak institutions pose a serious threat to democracy in Nigeria, regretting that &#8220;the voice of the people no longer counts. It&#8217;s only the select few that have dominated the space.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-democracy-has-been-destroyed-by-political-thieves-archbishop-onuagha\">Democracy has been destroyed by political thieves — Archbishop Onuagha</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To the Methodist Archbishop of Okigwe Archdiocese, Most Rev. Biereonwu Livinus Onuagha, former President Obasanjo, Obi and Bishop Kukah were right in their assertions that democracy has failed in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that every aspect of political leadership in Nigeria has shown traces of democracy failure, adding that political leaders have been covering up the failure of democracy but the Rivers State political crisis and the unwanted and unjustified State of emergency in Rivers State have exposed the failure of democracy in the country. For me it is only God that can save Nigeria.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borrowing the word of Socrates, Archbishops Onuagha, said: &#8220;Democracy must fall because it will try to tailor to everyone. The poor will want the wealth of the rich, and democracy will give it to them.<br>&#8220;Young people will want to be respected as elderly, and democracy will give it to them. Women will want to be like men, and democracy will give it to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Foreigners will want the rights of the natives and democracy will give it to them. Thieves and fraudsters will want important government functions, and democracy will give it to them. When thieves and fraudsters finally, and democratically take authority, because criminals and evil doers want power, there will be worse dictatorship than in the time of any monarchy or oligarchy. That is the situation in Nigeria.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why Nigeria’s democracy remains fragile, under siege — Ex-PDP spokesperson, CUPP</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ex- Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Diran Odeyemi and National Secretary of the Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, Chief Peter Ameh, expressed fears about the future of Nigeria’s democracy.“The pair who spoke in separate interviews with Vanguard, in Abuja, said the views expressed by Obasanjo about the problem with practice of western type of democracy in Nigeria was apt.“Obasanjo had lamented that democracy wasn’t working in Nigeria because it does not align with key African values, culture and needs.“Speaking on Obasanjo’s assertion, Odeyemi said: “Democracy isn’t working in Nigeria for a majority of Nigerians; because the average Nigerian politician is smarter than whatever Western style democracy throws up.““It is not only a leadership problem, it’s also about the followership who have been so impoverished that for as cheap as N5000, you can buy their conscience. It is sad that the kind of democracy we practice here is, ‘government by the few for the few and the interest of the few to the detriment of the majority.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking in a similar vein, Ameh said: “The notion that democracy is not working in Nigeria has been a recurring theme in recent times.“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sentiment has been expressed by numerous eminent Nigerians, including former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Peter Obi.“To assess the validity of this assertion, it is crucial to examine the various instances of misconduct and impunity exhibited by the three arms of government – the executive, legislative, and judiciary.“This assertion is not mere rhetoric but a reflection of deep-seated institutional failures marked by executive overreach, legislative impunity, and judicial misconduct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The executive arm of government has been accused of disregarding the rule of law and ignoring the principles of separation of powers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For instance, the executive has been known to arrest and detain individuals without court orders, violating their fundamental human rights.““Furthermore, there have been numerous allegations of corruption and embezzlement against high-ranking government officials, including those in the executive arm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These actions undermine the integrity of the government and erode trust in the democratic process.““The legislative arm has also been accused of misconduct, particularly in its use of threats against citizens as a tool for political coercion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Rather than serving as a legitimate means of holding the executive accountable but unfortunately it has become a tool in the hands of the Executive by endorsing the undemocratic actions that undermines democracy like the state of emergency declared in Rivers State and that’s why it called a rubber stamp legislature, this tactics have been employed to settle political scores and silence opposition voices.“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Additionally, allegations of corruption and bribery have been leveled against lawmakers, further undermining the integrity of the legislative process.“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The judiciary, which is supposed to be the bastion of justice and fairness, has also been accused of misconduct. Judicial corruption, including the acceptance of bribes to influence the outcome of cases, has been a persistent problem.“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Moreover, the judiciary has been accused of issuing court orders that contradict the content of the case brought before them and working with the executive branch to use judgment to stifle the citizens&#8217; civic rights to protest m, undermining the rule of law and the principles of justice.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democracy can&#8217;t work when constitutional processes are flouted – Diwe</p>\n\n\n\n<p>National President of the Association of Igbo Town Unions, ASITU, Chief Emeka Diwe, said democracy can&#8217;t work in Nigeria when constitutional processes are hardly followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His words: &#8220;Why won&#8217;t democracy collapse when one person appears to control the three arms of government? Why won&#8217;t democracy collapse when a state of emergency was declared without following due process and President Bola Tinubu is behaving as if nothing is happening?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an understatement that former President Obasanjo, Peter Obi, Bishop Hassan Kukah and others say that democracy isnt working in the country. It&#8217;s certainly an understatement, the problem is even more than they said.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-our-democracy-has-become-anything-goes-peretei\">Our democracy has become anything goes — Peretei</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Publicity Secretary of the People&#8217;s Democratic Party, PDP, in Ondo state, Hon Kennedy Peretei said: &#8220;Nigerian democracy has become what a former Army Chief described as &#8220;&#8216;anything goes&#8221;. If individuals can boast of buying judgments from the Supreme Court or other courts, what is remaining of our democracy?<br>“If elections are won in the (compromised Courts) and not through the ballot, what hope is left for democracy? Until INEC is truly independent and the common man can get justice from our courts, democracy will remain an illusion.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fadaka-adewale-omololu-hassan-ogunsuyi-oyintiloye-speak\">Fadaka, Adewale, Omololu, Hassan, Ogunsuyi, Oyintiloye speak</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Political analyst, Hon Ayo Fadaka, said: &#8220;Our democracy is corrupted, befuddled and dangerously spiralling. This of course is predicated on the fact that our society is sick, bereft of cogent values, seriousness and focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The problem with Nigeria is the quality and patriotism of those who govern us. It is a fact some of them have faced the law as accused persons, some convicted felons and many have been indicted in various administrative panels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Direct consequences of the foregoing is that those atop of our affairs are not nationalistic and patriotic, they do not care for the interest and well-being of the nation and it&#8217;s citizenry.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Ondo State Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, Hon Stephen Adewale, said: &#8220;Our democracy is undoubtedly navigating stormy waters, and while some voices wail over its supposed stagnation, let us not feign amnesia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We were here when President Olusegun Obasanjo, intoxicated by power, pulled every conceivable string to secure an ill-fated third term. Under his reign, states of emergency were declared with the swiftness of a royal decree, and governors were toppled like chess pieces, as Oyo State painfully witnessed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8221; And let us not forget Peter Obi’s gubernatorial reign, where local government autonomy was strangled into submission, and elections became a relic of the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yet, our democracy endured. It did not crumble beneath the weight of tyranny then, and it will not collapse now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Organising Secretary, of the Pan Yoruba Socio-Political Group, Afenifere, Abagun Kole Omololu, said: &#8220;The recent remarks by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, Mr. Peter Obi and Bishop Matthew Kukah regarding the state of democracy in Nigeria warrant thoughtful reflection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While concerns about governance and democratic institutions are legitimate, it is important to engage in constructive discourse that advances democracy rather than diminishing public confidence in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nigeria&#8217;s democratic journey, like those of many nations, has faced challenges. Issues such as executive overreach, constitutional gaps, electoral disputes, and institutional weaknesses have tested the resilience of our democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;However, these challenges are not insurmountable. Democracy is an evolving system that requires continuous strengthening, reforms, and principled leadership.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The President of Yoruba Council Worldwide, YCW, Aare Oladotun Hassan said: &#8221; l would like to address the assessments made by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Peter Obi, Bishop Matthew Kukah, and others regarding the state of democracy in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Their concerns resonate with many Nigerians who are deeply invested in our democratic processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The assertion that democracy in Nigeria is &#8220;no longer working&#8221; is a serious indictment and raises critical questions about the effectiveness of our institutions, the integrity of our electoral processes, and the overall responsiveness of our government to the needs of its citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have witnessed numerous challenges, including corruption, insecurity, and economic hardship, which collectively undermine the democratic ideals we aspire to uphold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While Nigeria has made significant strides in its democratic journey, transitioning from military rule to civilian governance, we must confront the realities of our current situation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Commissioner for information and Civic Orientation in Ekiti State, Mr Lanre Ogunsuyi, said: “In my own opinion Nigeria&#8217;s democracy faces significant challenges, the current system is flawed and needs to be reformed and its current trajectory has to be improved upon”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Osun State lawmaker, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, disagreed with Obasanjo, saying democracy still thrives in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One major pointer to this is the last general election, where incumbent governors and lawmakers lost and new and unknown persons emerged and took over their seats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All the pointers of democracy witnessed during Obasanjo&#8217;s regime are still thriving in our democracy now, so, what is the former President talking about?”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/03/failed-democrazy-nigerians-divided-as-presidency-tackles-obi-others/\">Failed Democrazy: Nigerians divided as Presidency tackles Obi, others</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>\n','Failed Democrazy: Nigerians divided as Presidency tackles Obi, others','Clifford Ndujihe, Dayo Johnson, John Alechenu , Rotimi Ojomoyela, Chimaobi Nwaiwu, Steve Oko, Shina Abubakar, Chinonso Alozie &amp; Adeola Badru,Top Stories,ibspotlight','•Watch your words, Onanuga warns Obi •We&amp;#8217;ll hold Onanuga responsible if harm befalls Obi – Obidient Movt Wabara, Sara-Igbe, Ikimi, Owie, Ambakederimo, clerics, others speak By Clifford Nd...','1','1','0',NULL,'1','https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/peter-obi-speaker.jpeg','0','0',NULL,NULL,'0','0','0','2025-03-26 06:18:34','2025-03-26 06:18:34','1'),

With all the Board Members seated and the CBN Governor presiding as Chairman, he made a brief statement and then handed me a letter. To my shock, the letter declared that Oceanic Bank should cease operations immediately. Stunned, I questioned his authority to take such a drastic measure without prior warning, which was contrary to normal banking practice. As I spoke, I noticed the grim expressions on the faces of the Board Members. Some of them subtly urged me to take the letter and leave, fearing that I might be arrested on the spot. I took the letter and left the meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I was returning to my office at Oceanic Bank, a staff member called me in a panic. He informed me that military personnel had surrounded my office and warned me not to return, as news was spreading that I had been declared a &ldquo;wanted person.&rdquo; The situation was so bewildering that I did not know what to do. Instead of heading to my office, I drove straight home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I arrived, I found my residence filled with sympathisers. My husband, thankfully, was in the United States receiving medical treatment at the time. Various dignitaries visited me, each offering different pieces of advice. Some urged me to flee to Lom&eacute; that same night to escape Nigeria, warning that the CBN Governor and his allies from King&rsquo;s College would relentlessly pursue me until I was arrested and imprisoned indefinitely, with little hope of release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I kept asking myself, &ldquo;What have I done wrong?&rdquo; but I was repeatedly told that it was not about what I had done &mdash; the CBN Governor was prepared to fabricate charges against me. Still, I refused to become a fugitive. I reminded them that I was responsible for 27,000 employees at Oceanic Bank. My visitors begged me to seek refuge, either in Lagos or outside the country. My children were devastated, unsure of what to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After hiding in different places for more than ten days, I decided to surrender to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) as advised by my lawyer. I was assured that I would not be detained due to my deteriorating health and that the EFCC would only take my statement before allowing me to seek medical attention. But the reality was entirely different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was detained for over a month. There was always one excuse or another to keep me there &mdash; one more statement to make, one more document to sign. This continued endlessly until formal charges were filed against me. I pleaded not guilty to all the baseless allegations. The next step was for my lawyers to secure my bail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bail struggle</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conditions for my bail were unusually stringent: at least two senators of the Nigerian Federation had to stand as sureties before I could be released. The then Governor of Delta State, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, intervened by sending Federal Representatives of Delta State origin to act as sureties. Additionally, Chief E.K. Clark, Chief Fred Brume, and my brother-in-law, a former Governor and Senator, Olorogun Felix Ibru, stepped in to secure my bail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I was finally released from EFCC custody, I went straight to Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) for a medical check-up. The doctors conducted a series of tests, and my heart condition raised serious concerns. I was referred to a cardiologist, a female doctor who made me feel at ease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, my children and family were pressuring me to accept a plea bargain as a way to put an end to the ongoing ordeal. I resisted fiercely, determined to fight for my innocence. However, I was soon threatened with rearrest and fresh charges, which, I was warned, would be even worse than before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reluctantly, I agreed on one condition: I needed clearance from my cardiologist, Professor Ajulochukwu of LUTH. She performed a thorough examination and gave me the green light to proceed. With that assurance, I travelled to Abuja with my youngest daughter to finalise the plea bargain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We arrived safely, but about twenty minutes from the airport, I began experiencing strange pains on the left side of my chest, radiating down my left arm. At first, I ignored it, but as we approached Abuja, the pain intensified. My daughter became worried and urged me to call my doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached Professor Ajulochukwu, who, after listening to my symptoms, urgently advised me to return to Lagos immediately. I followed her instructions. Upon my return, I went straight to her office, where she conducted preliminary tests and directed me for further cardiac examinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within two hours, the medical team called her with alarming results. She initially appeared calm but, upon reading the second set of results, her demeanour changed drastically. She called for assistance from her colleagues. When we pressed her to explain, she hesitated before finally revealing the diagnosis: &ldquo;heartbrokenness.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The professor immediately placed me on emergency treatment with Cleazine medication. Since the hospital pharmacy had ran out of supply, they had to source the drug from nearby pharmacies. I had to receive injections every three hours to prevent clotting in my heart and avoid an imminent heart attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was then referred to First Cardiology Hospital under the care of Dr Lawson, an American-trained cardiologist. After five days of intensive treatment, he referred me to Reddington Hospital on Victoria Island. My heart was now beating irregularly, and the doctors were deeply concerned</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From hospital to prison</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite my fragile condition, Reddington Hospital came under immense pressure from the CBN Governor&rsquo;s allies to discharge me. My legal team pleaded for more time, but suddenly, I was summoned to court to face the charges against me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My doctors and lawyers pleaded with the court for an extension, which was denied. Left with no choice, my lawyers advised me to plead guilty to one or two charges so that I could return to the hospital for treatment. However, the CBN Governor&rsquo;s legal team insisted that I be sent to Kirikiri Prison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we arrived at Kirikiri Maximum Security Prison, a group of officers surrounded our vehicle, ready to ensure my immediate incarceration. But I refused to leave the car. The more they pressured me, the harder I resisted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the officers informed me that they would call their Oga patapata &mdash; the senior prison officer &mdash; to force me out of the car. At that moment, reality hit me hard. Never in my life had I imagined myself in such a situation. I sat in that car, overwhelmed, asking myself:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What have I done to deserve such cruel treatment?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I thank God that I had the privilege of running a successful bank &mdash; one that became a force to be reckoned with in Nigeria&rsquo;s financial sector. Oceanic Bank was one of the top banks in the country, striving to be number one. We were actively involved in the Nigerian Public-Private Programme, supporting initiatives that encouraged private companies to acquire government enterprises through the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oceanic Bank played a key role in the privatisation of several government companies, including the National Fertiliser Company of Nigeria (NAFCON) in Port Harcourt. Another major project we funded was ECONET, Nigeria&rsquo;s second mobile telecommunications company, coming after MTN. We were also instrumental in financing the Murtala Muhammed Airport Terminal 2 (MM2). These were massive projects that required significant financial backing, and we were proud to be the bank that supported them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through these investments, we built a strong portfolio of holding credits, which we later sold to other banks seeking quality assets. First Bank, for instance, acquired credits trom Oceanic Bank, including those related to Airtel, NAFCON, and MM2. Given all we had achieved, I could never have imagined that one day, my name would be dragged through the mud, leading to my incarceration in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond large-scale projects, Oceanic Bank was also steadfast in its resolve to empowering small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We provided credit facilities to retailers and micro-businesses (MSMEs), ensuring that financial support reached the grassroots. We also introduced housing and car loan schemes for our employees, enabling them to access these essential assets with little or no down payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These efforts were in line with the challenge set by President Olusegun Obasanjo, who urged the banking sector to help grow Nigeria&rsquo;s middle class.

Any ruling party which is able to control this troika is guaranteed to dominate power for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lagos is the richest and most populous state. It has always been in the tight grip of the party through Tinubu. Kano, which accounts for the highest number of electoral votes was once an APC preserve until Rabiu Kwankwaso succeeded in taking it over with his New Nigerian People’s Party, NNPP, in 2023. Rivers was briefly an APC state between November 26, 2013 and May 29, 2015 when Governor Chibuike Amaechi decamped along with four other rebellious Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governors to the nascent APC. But the PDP retook Rivers State in the 2015 election with Nyesom Wike as the Governor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember how the APC National Chairman, John Oyegun, had openly lamented their loss of Rivers State to the PDP. He called it “one of the resource-rich states”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “resource” of Rivers State which he referred to was not necessarily the hefty revenue profile. For sure, Rivers generates the second largest revenue in the country after Lagos, with the second highest Gross Domestic Product, GDP, ranking. In 2024, the Lagos State budget crossed the trillion naira mark with Rivers unveiling the second highest budgetary figure of N800bn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What sets Rivers aside and makes it water the mouths of party leaders like Tinubu, is the propensity of its governors to splash the cash on their political ambitions and projects. Rivers State is the most politically “gregarious” among the 36 states. Lagos and Kano come into the picture during campaigns and elections or crises. Rivers governors habitually throw around money from their state treasuries more than any other. They not only spend on their state politics (as other governors do), they spend heavily on federal politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike any other, all three previous Rivers State Governors – Peter Odili, Amaechi and Wike – reportedly bankrolled their political parties at the centre and spent a lot of money running for president. In hopes of being anointed as former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s successor, Odili reportedly funded Obasanjo’s political projects. Also, in hopes of becoming Buhari’s successor, Amaechi allegedly massively supported the APC and Buhari’s 2015 election, served him as Minister of Transport and ran for president in 2023. Amaechi was overwhelmed with cosmic shock when Buhari refused to lift a finger to return his favours when he vied as APC presidential candidate and lost to Tinubu at Eagle Square, Abuja in June 2022. All he got was a miserable chieftaincy title: Dan Amanar Daura (Trusted Son of Daura) from the Emir of Daura, Umar Farouk. He had read it as a sign of Buhari’s impending endorsement which never came! Amaechi is still licking his wounds and gradually drifting away from the APC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Wike opened the Rivers treasury and used it to save the PDP from extinction between 2015 and 2023. The APC Federal Government was determined to destroy the party that kept them from Aso Villa for 16 years, but Wike not only bankrolled the party with Rivers people’s money, he also sponsored many PDP candidates, including himself, when he ran for president in 2023 and lost to Atiku Abubakar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These “bull in the china shop” antics that Wike is putting on against his rebellious handpick, Governor Siminalayi Fubara, as well as his war on PDP, are his struggles for political survival and revanches against those whom he felt betrayed him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wike refused to go home like his predecessors after serving two full terms. He wanted to play Jagaban. He started romancing Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate. He helped him win a dubious victory in Rivers State. Tinubu enveloped him in a loving embrace with appointment as FCT Minister. Tinubu knew the crisis between Wike and his estranged godson, Fubara, was a fight for the control of the juicy Rivers till, APC’s long-coveted treasure trove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Wike pleasantly surprised him (and many of us) with sterling performance as FCT Minister, Tinubu’s original “love” for Wike was because through him, he would be able to directly call the shots with regard to the electoral and financial bounties or booties of Rivers State. I believe strongly that the plot for the unconstitutional state of emergency in Rivers State started hatching the moment Fubara and Wike’s quarrels became irreconcilable about 18 months ago.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if a state of emergency was needful, he could have done it the President Goodluck Jonathan way &#8211; without dissolving political structures. It is such a sick irony that Tinubu freely badmouthed Jonathan when he declared emergency rule in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in 2013 over the Boko Haram terrorism, despite that Jonathan left the democratic structures intact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tinubu now has a retired naval officer, Ibok-Ete Ibas, who has over N500 billion Rivers people’s money at his fingertips in the next six months, on his leash. This one is “direct picking”. Indeed, Tinubu has force-ripened the fruit. Wike may be jumping for joy now, but his own uppercut is on the way. Tinubu will discard him “when” his takeover is complete. Who needs an agent when he can serve himself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Rivers is NOT Lagos.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/03/rivers-force-ripened-and-harvested-by-ochereome-nnanna/\">Rivers: Force-ripened and harvested, by Ochereome Nnanna</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>\n','Rivers: Force-ripened and harvested, by Ochereome Nnanna','Ochereome Nnanna decoding=async srcset=https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ochereome-Nnanna-1024x332.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Ochereome-Nnanna-768x249.jpg 768w sizes=(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px />,Columns,ibspotlight','The state of emergency President Bola Tinubu imposed on Rivers State is like bringing down fruit and force-ripening it for consumption.

So, for those of you beating drums of war, threatening fire and brimstone, it is up to the opposition to do its worst. It is now left for the relevant experts to debate the constitutionality of his action and, if possible, leave it to the courts to give proper interpretations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the whole shenanigans should have been handled more appropriately without the wounds and bruises that have been inflicted on all sides. We used to say discretion is the better part of valour. In this situation, it was totally lacking. Nyesom Wike, Siminalayi Fubara, 27 state house of assembly members, and all the busy bodies and meddlesome interlopers played their part in getting us to this quagmire. Fubara is not the first godson to go against his godfather in the Nigerian political dispensation. The difference in his case was his inability to find support from the people who put him in power. Is it an indication of his weak political skills? I should think so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this country,&nbsp; we always want to eat the cake and have it at the same time. We are all hypocrites, only fighting for what we can get from every situation. If not, things would not have gotten to this extent. In this matter, every one of us is guilty, except the poor, innocent people of Rivers State facing the brunt of all the shenanigans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wike is a man most people love to hate, but you must give it to him as a formidable opponent to engage with. You cannot say that Bola Tinubu being in power now is the reason Wike is exhibiting hubris.We saw him take on the dreaded President Muhammadu Buhari to the end. What is the thing that makes Wike tick? It is for scholars of politics and human behaviour to unravel and give us answers because the politics of Wike is a full course of study if the academics decide to interrogate it further. But that is not my focus in this piece.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am interested in parties on both sides of the divide who have egged the principal parties on to this extent. Maybe this will serve as a case study for future godfather and godson relationship in our political ecosystems. From the beginning, Fubara has proven himself to be what we call in Warri pidgin English as &#8220;apamper,&#8221; a weakling who can be pushed here and there by contending forces. He is neither here nor there. He gives the impression that he is amenable to a peaceful resolution of the whole matter, while on the other hand, he is stalling progress in the conflict resolution. A leader must take a stand and not be neither here nor there, he must be courageous. Having taken a stand, he must resolve to abide by it. Fubara gives the impression that he is a man of peace, but on the other hand, the actions of his government reveal a different picture. He is not the first godson to rebel against a godfather. We have a surfeit of them: Ganduje, Obaseki, Obiano, Soludo, even the present governor of Kaduna State, Sani Uba.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the powers at his disposal, Fubara failed to act decisively as a leader, and that is where he failed. Before him, we had Peter Odili, Chibuike Amaechi and Nyesom Wike. All of them were strong leaders who diminished their individual predecessors and became strong politicians at the national level, going on to contest for the presidency of the nation. Fubara is not in their class, and that is why he failed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Wike, the problem I have with him is his brashness, arrogance, and unforgiven spirit. Wike could have done all of these things quietly, underground without anyone knowing that he was behind it, but that is not for him. He must claim glory for everything. Incidentally, he is working under the master of political chess game. He should have learnt how Ambode was shoved out of the governorship seat, with the master mind in the background. That is a lesson for Wike to learn. Humility is a virtue that no leader must take for granted. He must be open to respect the views and opinions of others and must not be too loud, even in disagreement with others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Fubara&#8217;s government, the state House of Assembly was destroyed, making it difficult for the house to sit and conduct business. Knowing that their role is crucial to the success of his government, I believe he should have found a way to win a reasonable percentage of them over to his side; this could take time but would have paid off in the end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great Adam Oshiomhole once told the story of how his government was stifled by the opposition when he first took over the reins of government. They were taking his budget to Tony Anenih in Abuja everytime for approval before the house passed it; but he ultimately found a way to bring such illegality to an end. And when he did, heavens did not fall.&nbsp; Former Governor Fashola also managed to meander his way through to a reelection and further appointments as minister in the federal cabinet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is the point I am trying to make. But even at that, Fubara appears to have won the sympathy of the people as the underdog. The impression is that Wike was overreaching himself. It would have been very difficult for the impeachment plan to go through without a conflagration. It was bound to happen, and I believe it is the major reason that the President intervened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From what I am seeing, things can still be resolved in an amicable manner unless the meddlesome interlopers continue with their negative counsel that will do the antagonists no good. I believe this lull period can be used for useful meditation that will make them think service to the state first. There must be room for compromises that will usher in a fresh direction for the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I mentioned earlier, no party is innocent in this matter when you look at issues dispassionately. It must be noted that those who brought an ethnic slant into the whole matter did not do their candidate any favour, they only succeeded in escalating the whole situation and bringing unnecessary tension in the whole Niger Delta area. After all, when Wike stepped on heavy toes to put their son in power, none of them was there. Capitalising on the situation and playing the tribal card was descending very low. Encouraging pipeline sabotage and other forms of criminality in the region will only take them backwards as they will be the first casualty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me end this piece with Dele Farotimi&#8217;s quote: &#8220;At no point since this imbroglio started has anybody talked about the interests of the people of Rivers State. It&#8217;s been about the overbloated ego of the aspiring Hitler of Rivers State, who is your FCT minister, and the inability of Siminalayi to keep his own part of whatever devil&#8217;s bargain they struck, when he was being imposed on the people &#8220;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have nothing more to add to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>  *Ikhioya wrote via: <a href=\"http://www.southsouthecho.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">http://www.southsouthecho.com </a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/03/the-rivers-crisis-was-avoidable/\">The Rivers crisis was avoidable</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>\n','The Rivers crisis was avoidable','SUNNY IKHIOYA,Viewpoint,ibspotlight','By SUNNY IKHIOYA President Bola Tinubu has finally wielded the big stick and declared a state of emergency in the troubled Rivers State.

This decision is necessary to avoid a mismatch between our sales proceeds and our crude oil purchase obligations, which are currently denominated in US dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To date, our sales of petroleum products in naira have exceeded the value of naira-denominated crude we have received. As a result, we must temporarily adjust our sales currency to align with our crude procurement currency.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October last year, the Federal Government announced that the supply of crude oil to the Dangote Refinery in Naira by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, NNPCL, would last for initial six months subject to review by the Technical Subcommittee on Domestic Sales of Crude Oil in Local Currency. Dangote has resorted to purchasing crude oil from the international market following the failure to renew the crude-for Naira supply arrangement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry watchers see NNPCL’s failure to renew the arrangement from two prisms. The first is that the Federal Government had pledged a large amount of our daily oil quota to international creditors. With our subsisting inability to meet our 2.2 million barrels per day OPEC quota, the NNPCL is unable to meet the Naira supply needs of our local refiners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some also see the lack of proactiveness in renewing the deal as part of the perceived feuds between the two domestic refiners over market control and product pricing. Dangote has always led the initiative to sell at lower prices and keep dropping pump prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the true story is, it is the Nigerian consumer that is negatively impacted. Nigerians celebrated the restoration of local refining of our petroleum products by our newly-built or refurbished refineries in the hope they would help in cushioning the harsh effects of total withdrawal of subsidy on petrol and other products. Indeed, they have enjoyed a measure of price reductions and looked forward to more of same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement by Dangote Refineries saw their product pump price jumping to N900 per litre from N860 in Lagos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We urge the Federal Government to wade into this matter and ensure the renewal of the crude for Naira policy.

With our lives increasingly reliant on digital platforms—from banking apps to social media, the security and accessibility of digital assets are paramount, not merely a convenience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech advisor Akin Ibitoye recently emphasized the critical need for robust data security and backup practices, particularly in light of the escalating cyber threat landscape and widespread gaps in basic data protection awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The urgency of this issue is underscored by Nigeria’s alarming rise on the Global Threat Index. Between May and December 2024, the nation surged from 35th to 13th position, indicating a dramatic escalation in cyberattacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concurrently, Nigeria’s normalized risk index escalated sharply from 46.5 percent to 62.3 percent within the same timeframe, further highlighting the heightened vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System, NIBSS, reports a substantial incidence of financial fraud, frequently involving the compromise of sensitive personal and financial data. Specifically, NIBSS data reveals that 80,658 unique customers fell victim to fraudulent activities in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These figures underscore the tangible and significant impact of cybercrime on individuals and the financial sector, emphasizing the necessity for increased vigilance and proactive security measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why backing up data is a must</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine moving to a new house and realizing one has lost half of his belongings in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what happens when one switch devices without a proper backup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whether its contacts, emails, documents, or cherished photos, failing to back up data can lead to unnecessary frustration and even financial loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibitoye explains: “The first step is identifying the data you need to back up. Backups can be stored in the cloud or on an external device. This allows you to restore your information to a new device with minimal downtime.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“While many users are familiar with cloud storage options like Google Drive, iCloud, and OneDrive, few actively utilize them to their full potential. Scheduling regular backups ensures that even in cases of phone theft or a sudden device crash, your data remains safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syncing for seamless transitions</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest struggles people face when changing devices is retrieving their browser history, saved passwords, and bookmarks. Fortunately, modern browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Firefox offer synchronization features that allow users to log in and pick up where they left off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibitoye said: “This simple step can save hours of frustration, if you log in and sync your browser, all your data, history, passwords, bookmarks, will be restored automatically when you switch devices.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WhatsApp and the rising threat of cyber attacks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With over two billion users worldwide, WhatsApp is a prime target for cybercriminals. Losing access to an account can be disastrous, especially for businesses that rely on the platform for communication with clients. To protect against hackers, Ibitoye advises enabling two-factor authentication, 2FA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Even if someone manages to hack your WhatsApp, they won’t get past the second level of authentication,” he explains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regularly backing up WhatsApp chats is another critical step. By doing this, users can recover conversations even if their device is lost or compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The password problem</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Passwords remain one of the weakest links in digital security. Many users opt for simple, easy-to-remember combinations like “1234” or their birthdates—choices that hackers can easily guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibitoye warns against this: “With AI-driven hacking tools, it’s now easier than ever to crack weak passwords. Always use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also emphasizes the importance of updating passwords regularly and using biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) alongside a PIN for an extra layer of security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saving time with keyboard shortcuts</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond security, efficiency is another crucial aspect of digital literacy. Many users don’t realize they can save up to 64 hours a year by mastering basic keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance: CTRL + A (Select all), CTRL + C (Copy), CTRL + V (Paste), CTRL + Z (Undo)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, one thing even keyboard shortcuts can’t fix is an emptied recycle bin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Once you delete files from the recycle bin, they’re gone for good,” Ibitoye cautions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping software up to date</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another often-overlooked aspect of security is software updates. Many users ignore update notifications, not realizing they often contain critical security patches that protect against new cyber threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ibitoye advises: “Update your software regularly. “If you have an antivirus or internet security programme, make sure it’s up to date as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Data security isn’t just for tech-savvy individuals—it’s for everyone. Whether it’s backing up data, enabling 2FA, or using strong passwords, small actions can prevent significant losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As cyber threats evolve, so must peoples’ approach to digital safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The best time to start securing your data is now because in the digital world, prevention is always better than recovery.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/03/digital-safety-net-why-backing-up-securing-data-matters/\">Digital safety net: Why backing up, securing data matters</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>\n','Digital safety net: Why backing up, securing data matters','Juliet Umeh,Technology,ibspotlight','By Juliet Umeh In today’s hyper-connected world, data loss can be as devastating as losing one’s physical possessions.

Pylori Lurks in Nigerian Stomachs, Experts Say&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>… Adds: Prevalence rate far exceeds global average</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>By Chioma Obinna</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Nigeria grapples with visible epidemics of diseases, researchers at the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research, NIMR, on Tuesday warned that a silent, pervasive threat lurks within the stomachs of millions, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), demanding urgent attention to the bacterial infection that silently fuels gastritis, ulcers, and gastric cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>H. pylori refers to a type of bacteria that infects the stomach lining. It is a major cause of gastritis (stomach inflammation), peptic ulcers (sores in the stomach or small intestine), and even gastric cancer in some cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Director of Research and Professor of Microbiology at NIMR, Professor Stella Smith, lamented that with a prevalence of 85 to 87 per cent, only a few Nigerians are aware of its risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said, &#8220;Helicobacter pylori infects the stomach of 43 per cent of the world&#8217;s population but in Nigeria, the prevalence is a staggering 85-87 per cent. Yet, it remains largely ignored, underfunded, and misunderstood.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smith, who has dedicated years to the diagnosis and treatment of the pathogen, said the prevalence rate in Nigeria was far above the global average of 43 percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“H. pylori is silently infecting millions, yet receives little attention or funding compared to diseases like Ebola and COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing journalists during the institute’s monthly media parley in Lagos, he stressed the urgent need for greater awareness, better diagnostic methods, and improved treatment adherence to combat antimicrobial resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She explained that, unlike airborne viruses, H. pylori is acquired through contaminated food and water, often in childhood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We found that 80 per cent of H. pylori-positive cases were children under 10 in some regions, adding that, the bacteria&#8217;s insidious nature lies in its ability to persist for decades, often without immediate symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It causes, at minimum, gastritis, inflammation of the stomach, but it can lead to far more severe complications, including gastric cancer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She further disclosed that a critical challenge is the growing resistance to antibiotics, a direct result of misuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In our seven-year study, we found that 95 per cent of H. pylori strains were resistant to metronidazole (Flagyl).”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“H. pylori is a bacterial infection that can be treated and cured with antibiotics. However, treatment requires two antibiotics over 10 to 14 days, and many patients stop taking their medication too soon, leading to drug resistance,” she stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She emphasised the urgent need for tailored treatment regimens.&nbsp;&#8220;People take antibiotics for a few days, feel better, and stop, fueling this resistance.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expert&#8217;s frustration is palpable when discussing the lack of awareness and funding. &#8220;People are being told it&#8217;s not treatable, that they just need to manage symptoms with PPIs,&#8221; they lament. &#8220;That&#8217;s simply not true. It&#8217;s a bacterial infection; it can be eradicated.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To combat this, the expert founded the African Helicobacter and Microbiota Study Group, aiming to establish best management practices across the continent. &#8220;We&#8217;ve created an online registry to track treatment regimens and eradication rates. This will allow us to identify the most effective antibiotics for our local setting.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking on other critical public health issues, including cholera and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), she said, &#8220;Cholera outbreaks, especially in regions like the southeast and south-south, remain a serious concern. We&#8217;ve been on the ground, working with government and international agencies to contain these outbreaks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding AMR, the expert, who heads the NIMR AMR committee, warned of its silent pandemic status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Before COVID-19, WHO recognised AMR as one of the top urgent disease threats worldwide,&#8221; they highlight. Millions are dying annually from antibiotic-resistant infections. We must act now to curb this crisis. We need to educate, inform, and act. Millions of lives depend on it,&#8221; she added.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/03/silent-killer-nimr-seeks-action-as-h-pylori-infects-87-of-nigerians/\">Silent Killer: NIMR seeks action as H.

This is the same way Hitler hijacked the German democracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Afenifere calls on all people of goodwill to rise legitimately to restore the rule of law, ensure best democratic practice and save the Nigerian democracy.

Others arrange interested buyers at any of the terminals across the country, even before the arrival of the victim, thereby making it fast for the gang leader to dispose of the stolen children and collect her money,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Director General of NAPTIP, Binta Bello, while appreciating the Director General of the DSS, in Abuja, for his sustained support to the agency which, she said, culminated in the arrest of the human trafficking syndicate, however, expressed sadness over the situation, describing it as a heinous crime against humanity.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/03/naptip-busts-human-trafficking-ring-foils-sale-of-stolen-3-year-old/\">NAPTIP busts human trafficking ring, foils sale of stolen 3-year-old</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>\n','NAPTIP busts human trafficking ring, foils sale of stolen 3-year-old','Evelyn Usman,News,ibspotlight','….Arrests female truck driver, six others By Evelyn Usman The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, NAPTIP, has busted an interstate human trafficking syndicate, arresting ...','1','1','0',NULL,'1','https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-392-1024x683.png','0','0',NULL,NULL,'0','0','0','2025-03-26 06:18:34','2025-03-26 06:18:34','0'),

It is about ensuring their rights are acknowledged, advocating for inclusivity, and increasing awareness. Here in Nigeria, there is still significant stigma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Many people do not even understand what Down syndrome is. When they see someone with a disability, they either react with shock or pity. But we are here to change that narrative, persons with disabilities have rights, just like you and me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stressing the need to integrate individuals with Down syndrome into society by providing equal opportunities in education and employment, Dennis noted that while some disabilities, such as mobility or visual impairments, are more visible in workplaces, individuals with intellectual disabilities, including those with Down syndrome, are often marginalized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You may see a wheelchair user at work or a visually impaired person making progress, but how often do you see someone with an intellectual disability in a professional setting?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;The assumption that they cannot contribute meaningfully is false. They need support, not exclusion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She lamented the lack of reliable data on persons with Down syndrome in Nigeria, calling it a major challenge. While global statistics estimate that one in 700 children is born with Down syndrome, there is no concrete local data to guide policymaking and service provision in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This lack of data affects everything, from government policies to healthcare services. We are still relying on global estimates. But to implement meaningful change, we need to know the actual numbers in Nigeria.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calling for stronger partnerships between NGOs, the government, and healthcare institutions to ensure accurate data collection from birth, Dennis stated: &#8220;It starts with collaboration. Hospitals must engage with us from the moment a child is diagnosed. We cannot collect data alone. The government must prioritize this as part of the national census and health records.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lending her voice, renowned human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Funmi Falana, called for urgent improvements in the support systems available to vulnerable individuals in the country. Speaking at an event themed &#8220;Improve Our Support System,&#8221; Falana emphasized the collective responsibility of the government, the public, and families in ensuring the rights and welfare of vulnerable persons are protected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Falana said vulnerable individuals, particularly those with disabilities, continue to face discrimination, neglect, and lack of access to essential services despite legal provisions protecting them. She cited Section 42 of the Nigerian Constitution, which prohibits discrimination based on physical ability, sex, or place of birth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are saying that because of what nature has dealt them, we as a society need to give them more support than those who are less vulnerable. There should be no discrimination, and they should have access to the same rights and privileges as every other citizen,&#8221; she stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlighting systemic failures in healthcare services for vulnerable persons, Falana noted that medical officers are often not adequately trained to handle their needs. She also criticized the government&#8217;s lack of commitment to implementing policies that ensure specialized medical care for these individuals, despite the National Health Insurance Act, which mandates accessible healthcare for vulnerable groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most of the people in our hospitals are not trained to handle specific needs. You cannot expect a general practitioner to effectively manage patients with neurodevelopmental disorders without specialized training. We lack these experts, and the government is not doing enough to fill this gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some fathers say, ‘I don’t know where she brought this child from. It’s a child of the ghost, not a normal child.’ This is ignorance, and it must change. The public needs education on the fact that these individuals deserve our support, not sympathy, but equal rights,&#8221; she stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Falana urged the government to take immediate steps in training medical professionals to cater to vulnerable individuals and fully enforce laws that protect their rights. She also called on the public to discard discriminatory attitudes and actively support those in need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Support must come from all angles, government, families, and the public. We must remove the barriers that prevent vulnerable individuals from accessing opportunities that are rightfully theirs,&#8221; she added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emphasizing the need for early intervention and specialized care for children with Down syndrome, Dr. Olufunmilayo Akinola, a consultant neuropsychiatrist at the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Yaba, urged parents to seek professional support immediately after diagnosis due to the emotional, cognitive, and medical challenges these children face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The journey begins right from the hospital when a mother receives the diagnosis. It can be heart-wrenching, but the right support should start from that moment,&#8221; Akinola stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She explained that hospitals must deploy counselors and social workers to assist families in understanding the condition and linking them to appropriate medical and educational services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akinola reassured parents that Lagos has facilities equipped to handle the diverse needs of children with Down syndrome. She cited the Child and Adolescent Unit at the Osho Annex of the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital, which offers a multidisciplinary approach to care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have everything in one building, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, educationists, doctors, and psychologists. Parents must know that help is available,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/03/down-syndrome-experts-call-for-greater-inclusion-empowerment-of-affected-persons/\">Down Syndrome: Experts call for greater inclusion, empowerment of affected persons</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>\n','Down Syndrome: Experts call for greater inclusion, empowerment of affected persons','Esther Onyegbula,Health,ibspotlight','By Esther Onyegbula As Nigeria joined the global community to mark World Down Syndrome Day, stakeholders&amp;nbsp; in Lagos have called for the rights, inclusion, and empowerment of persons with Do...','1','1','0',NULL,'1','https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/down.jpg','0','0',NULL,NULL,'0','0','0','2025-03-26 06:18:34','2025-03-26 06:18:34','0'),

Industrialising a country is a conscious political decision arrived at by a deliberate process of identification of the nation’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as locating its place in history. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The convergence of political power and astute planning in the realm of the national economy are the two forces that are best suited to shape the destiny of any nation. China’s phenomenal rise and development in the last four decades or so, gives testimony to the role of the leadership of that country under the tutelage of the Communist Party of China, CPC, and its various apparatuses. The controlled and guided planning that led to the emergence of China as the global manufacturing superpower is not a miracle but the careful nurturing of strategies for establishing the country’s ascendency in the world economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, for Nigeria to achieve a similar role and status, the country’s leadership and political establishment must embrace a conscious path towards industrialising the country and modernising its productive forces. The mantra of the diversification of the economy has been pronounced ad nauseam and ad infinitum to the point that its has lost its meaning and currency altogether. A commitment to develop the country must start from the leadership and trickle downwards to the various levels of performers in the national programme of economic regeneration. This trend can only be assured with the adoption of policies and implementation of programmes on reform and readjustment of the economy along the lines of prudent management, selective investment, innovation and modernisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, as Nigeria stands on the crossroads, her fortunes can only be made worse by the wrong choices in policies while the correct choices will ultimately reinforce the belief that Nigeria still stands a chance to be among the top 25 developed nations of the world. Such a convergence is definitely needed at this time in Nigeria’s emergence and evolution as a democracy with great potentials as a global economic power. The rule of law and democratic governance are frameworks around which policies are constructed and decisions are taken in the direction to which a country should go. Ultimately however, there can be no substitute to the texture and tenor of the sound management of the national economy, and the marshaling of resources towards an accelerated transformation of Nigeria into a high performing economic power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going by the dictates of politics in this country, an astute manager of the economy who also understands the intricacies of 21st century challenges of nation-building has become imperative. Aggregating the various factors that make a country economically viable and prosperous, and accelerating the drivers of stability, predictability as well as accountability, are functions of the political class as evidenced by the examples of Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, China and several other countries that have emerged from the world’s economic back woods to take the leading position today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Undoubtedly, many initiatives have been adopted and put in place by previous administrations in the form of ease of doing business, for instance, and the various other efforts geared towards attracting investments into the country that at one point stabilised the Nigerian economy and saw the country emerge from a deep recession with relatively few adverse consequences. However, going beyond such expediences, a deliberate focus on rapid industrialisation should be formulated and pursued aggressively. Industrialisation of Nigeria is the greatest challenge that has continued to confront successive administrations in the country since independence in 1960. This factor underlines the greatest weakness and soft underbelly of the country that has deprived Nigeria the chance of becoming a world class power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critical deployment of skills in governance and the astute management of the economy are the two most significant factors in the achievement of economic development and industrialisation everywhere in the world today. Nigeria cannot therefore; be an exception to this rule. Industrialisation must be the minimum baseline that should be established by Nigerian politics, and the yardstick by which the success or failure of any administration should be determined. Without the concerted effort to do this, politics itself becomes meaningless in the sense that it can only lead Nigeria down a blind alley with no prospects of emergence from her state of indifferent existence and attaining the heights of significance and prosperity that she should rightly aspire to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is in this regard that the historical task of building a peaceful, prosperous and respectable nation to preserve the dignity of the Black Race should be aligned with the desire to industrialise and achieve a reasonable level of physical economic development that should translate into decent living for all Nigerians and other Africans. It is only in such a condition that the pursuit of the collective well-being of the African and Black Race can be meaningful and become an agenda around which Nigeria could galvanise the global African Diaspora. It is only Nigeria that has the potential and the capacity for the undertaking of such a historical task, especially as it relates to taking more seriously her role as the interlocutor for the Black Race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nigeria possesses all the relevant indicators to provide the necessary impetus that is needed towards creating the conditions for the emergence of a “Black Centre of Gravity” to reorient global opinion vis-a-vis issues of existential import such as inclusive racial cooperation towards solving global problems like racism and racial discrimination, xenophobia and associated human rights violations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industrialisation of Nigeria must therefore, be the scaffolding around which the Renaissance Project for the Black Race would be built that would encompass the vast range of identities and complex mixes of interests that define the condition of the African Diaspora today. Such an effort would not only need a strong personality in the mould of the early nationalist figures of Africa, but also a man of the moment who has passed through the crucible of politics to become a statesman of global repute.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/03/industrialising-nigeria-and-the-task-of-the-political-class1-by-usman-sarki/\">Industrialising Nigeria and the task of the political class(1), by Usman Sarki</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com\">Vanguard News</a>.</p>\n','Industrialising Nigeria and the task of the political class(1), by Usman Sarki','Usman Sarki decoding=async srcset=https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/usman-sarki-e1699421472475.jpeg 508w, https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/usman-sarki-e1699421472475-300x184.jpeg 300w sizes=(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px />,Columns,ibspotlight','&amp;#8220;The economic factor in the politics of a country is always a difficult matter to discuss, for it is made up of infinite details, some of them purely speculative, all of them hard to dise...','1','1','0',NULL,'1','https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/usman-sarki-e1699421472475.jpeg','0','1','This article is good (y)',NULL,'0','0','0','2025-03-26 06:18:34','2025-03-26 06:18:34','0'),

The decision to deploy a proactive policing strategy was informed by an emerging atmosphere that could have been exploited by troublemakers to plunge the state into insecurity and chaos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;I assure the good people of Rivers State that this is a temporary phase, and in due time, we will all witness a more peaceful and secured state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, I must stress the critical importance of securing critical national assets and infrastructure within Rivers State. These assets are vital, not only to the people of Rivers State but also to the entire nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Consequently, it is the collective responsibility of all well-meaning residents of the state to ensure their protection, particularly against oil thieves, vandals, kidnappers, cultists and other criminals.&rdquo;<br />\r\nAdepoju disclosed that the security team foiled several attempts by criminals to take advantage of developments in the state to vandalise critical assets of government, adding that one suspect died while attempting to detonate an explosive on the pipeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said: &ldquo;Over the past week, the joint efforts of the security agencies in Rivers State have, among other successes, thwarted attempts by miscreants to vandalise pipelines which led to the death of the vandal in the process of trying to detonate a pipeline at Aluu- Rumuekpe in Ikwerre LGA but for the quick intervention of security agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In other cases of anti-criminal activities in the state, men of the security forces stormed the hideout of kidnappers along Omoku Road in Ahoada East LGA on March 21, 2025, at about 0710 hours where eight male suspects were arrested, and six male victims rescued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Items recovered during the arrest include two English-made pump action guns, two locally made pistols, four locally-made single barrel guns with assorted rounds and catridges, three Q-link motorcycles, communication equipment, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Another case of criminality was voided in Onelga LGA on March 19, 2025, when two suspects were arrested with four dynamites, four switches and detonating pods and other IED enablers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is in addition to the destruction of 30 illegal refining sites, 55 ovens, 20 reservoirs, 50 dug-out pits, 100,000 litres of stolen crude oil and about 10,000 litres of illegally refined AGO, which were handled in line with extant regulations.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CP urged members of the public to provide the Police and other security agencies with credible intelligence regarding individuals or groups and their conspirators engaging in vandalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-nlc-tuc-threaten-strike-if-emergency-rule-s-not-reversed\">NLC, TUC threaten strike, if emergency rule&rsquo;s not reversed</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In a related development, Organized Labour in Rivers State yesterday expressed deep concern over the state of emergency declared in the state by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, threatening to embark on strike should the Federal Government fail to reverse it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labour strongly condemned suspension of the governor, deputy governor, and House of Assembly members who were elected by Rivers people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said the state of emergency has impacted local government workers who are yet to receive their salaries, thereby getting exposed to avoidable economic hardship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement jointly signed by chairperson of NLC in the state, Mr. Alex Agwanwo, and his TUC counterpart, Mr. Ikechukwu Onyefuru, Labour said considering the strategic importance of Rivers State in Nigeria&rsquo;s economy and the Niger Delta, the state of emergency has potential to negatively impact the economy at a time the nation is struggling with high inflation, naira devaluation, high exchange rate, rising unemployment, high cost of living and unaffordable electricity tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The labour movement in the state said the state of emergency has put the state at a very disadvantaged position, as potential investors who had indicated interest in the &lsquo;&rsquo;New Rivers Vision&rsquo;&rsquo; had all backed out of planned investments, thereby impairing growth of the state&rsquo;s IGR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It stated: &ldquo;While the Rivers State organized labour supports maintaining law and order, it insists that actions, such as declaration of state of emergency and suspending elected officials must align with the Nigerian constitution and protect workers from avoidable wage invalidity, non-payment of salaries at all levels, safety and security threats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Government must prioritise the safety and welfare of citizens over political interests. Rivers State organized labour is appealing to the President, National Assembly, and Judiciary to urgently reverse the premature state of emergency and suspension of elected officials and return the state to normalcy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Federal Government is strongly advised to engage in genuine dialogue to prevent further escalation of issues in Rivers State.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labour, however, advised all workers to remain calm and continue their duties, while awaiting a favourable response on concerns it raised, warning that it might be compelled to take strategic union actions which might disrupt national economic activities if its demands were not met within a reasonable time frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the strike threat, a national official of NLC who spoke to Vanguard on condition of anonymity, said: &ldquo;It is within their (Rivers NLC, TUC) purview to go on strike once their rights and welfare are threatened or undermined by events in the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;If the political situation in the state has become toxic for them to work without fear, intimidation, harassment and psychological well-being, including their democratic rights, they are covered by the law to go on strike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They are allowed to go on strike without violence. You can refer to our joint statement with our sister union, the TUC, in which we rejected the state of emergency and appointment of a sole administrator to govern Rivers State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;We equally called for its reversal, just like NBA, and other well-meaning groups and individuals. We canvassed and presented our position on the Rivers State issue in the joint statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So, the workers of Rivers State have the right to go strike without permission from the national because he who wears the shoes knows where it pinches.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-court-asked-to-sack-rivers-sole-administrator\">Court asked to sack

Ette Ibas, retd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While President Tinubu was cited as the 1st defendant, the Attorney-General of the Federation, Vice Admiral Ibas, retd, and Attorneys-General of the 36 states of the Federation were listed as 2nd to 39th defendants in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/572/2025, which was lodged before the court yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The suit, which was filed by an Abuja-based legal practitioner, Mr. Johnmary Jideobi, is equally praying the court to set-aside as void, &ldquo;all actions and decisions [howsoever described or made] of the 3rd Defendant (Vice Admiral Ibokette Ibas, retd) in the name of Sole Administrator of Rivers State, same being unconstitutional, null and of no constitutional force throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria for all purposes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plaintiff further prayed the court to issue a perpetual order of injunction, restraining the 1st defendant (Tinubu, either by himself, his officers, agents, privies, servants or any other person acting under his command howsoever named, &ldquo;from either removing, suspending or otherwise tampering with the tenure of the Governor and Deputy-Governor of Rivers State [and, indeed, any other state in Nigeria].&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plaintiff also prayed for an order of perpetual injunction barring President Tinubu, &ldquo;either by himself, his officers, agents, privies, servants or any other person acting under his command howsoever named, from appointing any Sole Administrator into any State Government House in the thirty (36) states of the federation for any purpose whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the originating summons filed through a consortium of lawyers, led by Mr. Chimezie Enuka, the plaintiff prayed the court to determine &ldquo;whether in view of the combined provisions of the entirety of Sections 1, 5(2), 180, 188, 189, 305 and 306 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended, and their conflated interpretation, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria [1st Defendant herein] has any constitutional authority [whatsoever] to either remove, suspend or otherwise tamper with the tenure of the duly-elected governor and deputy governor of Rivers State (and, indeed, of any other state in Nigeria) and appoint a Sole Administrator (or any other substitute howsoever called or described) such as the 3rd Defendant for that state?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon the determination of the question, he prayed the court to declare that upon an intimate reading and complete understanding of the entirety of section 305 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, there is NO other circumstance contemplated by the Constitution for the removal OR interruption of the tenure of an elected governor and deputy governor of a state EXCEPT the circumstances contemplated under Sections 180, 188, 189 and 306 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A declaration of this Honourable Court that in view of the entirety of Sections 1, 5(2), 180, 188, 189, 305 and 306 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of

governor of a state and appoint a Sole Administrator (or any other substitute howsoever called or described) such as the 3rd Defendant herein for that State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A declaration of this Honourable Court that the purported suspension of the governor and the deputy-governor of Rivers State of Nigeria by the 1st Defendant on Tuesday the 18th day of March, 2025, is unconstitutional, null

by the 1st Defendant as the Sole Administrator of Rivers State of Nigeria is unconstitutional, null and void and of no legal effect whatsoever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;An order of this Honourable Court setting aside the suspension of the governor and the deputy-governor of Rivers State of Nigeria by the 1st Defendant on Tuesday the 18th day of March, 2025 for being unconstitutional, null and void

the Government House of Rivers State of Nigeria.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 32-paragraph affidavit he deposed in support of the suit, the plaintiff maintained that though President Tinubu has the constitutional power to declare a state of emergency in deserving circumstances in any part of the federation, he does not have the power to suspend elected officials, such as a governor, who is not his appointee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As a Nigerian lawyer and all through my years of practice, I have never seen the word &lsquo;Sole Administrator&rsquo; in the amended 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know that neither the 1st Defendant nor the 2nd Defendant appointed the governor and deputy governor of Rivers State of Nigeria and that no governor or deputy governor in Nigeria is an appointee of the 1st and 2nd Defendants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know that Nigeria practices Federalism hinged on separation of powers.
